# pcaExplorer 2.12.0

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an error in the initialization of the app due to a new behavior introduced by `shinyAce` in version >= 0.4.0

## Other notes

* The type of the columns in the data.frame returned by `topGOtable` are now correctly referring to the type they contain - e.g. the p values are now stored as numeric values
* Citation now refers to the published manuscript - https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2879-1

# pcaExplorer 2.10.0

## New features

* Added extra parameters to `topGOtable` to offer more control on the method used, and the option to correct the p-values for multiple testing (via the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure)
* `pca2go` has now an option to return (early) a list with vectors of genes with high loadings
* Better preview of the uploaded data with modal dialog windows triggered by buttons which appear once corresponding inputs are available
* Improved notification system: in addition to the progress bar, info that all input is correctly specified, or suggest optional annotation loading
* Added flexibility to select separator for each of the uploadable files
* The pairwise correlation plots can now use logarithmic scale in the axes, use smaller subsets of the data for quicker inspection, and resizes the correlation info proportionally to its intensity
* The sample to sample heatmap supports additionally manhattan and correlation-based distances
* There is a new vignette with a detailed quick start, "Up and running with pcaExplorer", specifying how the workflow with `pcaExplorer` can look like, demonstrated on the `airway` dataset
* In the Instructions panel, we added buttons to access the fully rendered documentation, either local or online if e.g. deployed to a server. Related to this, `pcaExplorer` has a new parameter, `runLocal`, to control this behavior
* An additional parameter, `annopkg`, has been added to `pca2go()` to override the behavior with the `organism` parameter (this is useful when the name of the annotation package is not conform to the classical `org.Xx.eg.db`, e.g. for Arabidopsis Thaliana); a detailed use case has been added in the main vignette

## Other notes

* The computing of the required objects now requires the explicit action on the dedicated button, and the tooltip informs the user on what steps are taken (including normalization)
* An information box has been added to provide detailed information on the required input formats
* Added notification to specify how to install the airway package for demonstration purposes if not already available
* Added startup message upon loading the package
* The content in the Instructions tab is now contained in collapsible elements
* The file formats accepted by `pcaExplorer` are now specified both in the vignette text, as well as in the app at runtime
* The content of the Instructions tab is now more compact, containing the rendered "Up and running with pcaExplorer" vignette. The full vignettes can be accessed via buttons in the same panel
* Added instructions to install phantomJS via the `webshot` package - would raise an error when previewing the report

# pcaExplorer 2.8.0

## New features

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package
* PCA plots now are correctly generated with fixed coordinates
* Introduced use of conditionalPanels for better handling of errors in the app tabs
* Added possibility to use different transformations, also reflected in the change of one of the main arguments (previously `rlt`, now `dst`, i.e. `DESeqTransform`): rlog, vst, shifted log, ... The transformation type is tracked in the reactive values. 
* More modular loading of data, by splitting generation of `dds` and `dst`
* `pca2go` is now also picking values from the input widgets

## Other notes

* Built project website via pkgdown, with customized reference structure
* Correctly adding the resources to shinyBS, loaded via `.onLoad`, and also better placement for bstooltips
* Editor options start collapsed in the Report Editor tab
* Vignette and template report are updated to reflect the new parameter names
* Uniformed style for ggplot2 plots
* Better tooltip placement in the main page
* Replaced `print` calls with more appropriate `message`s
* Displaying user returned messages in long (plotting) operations

## Bug fixes

* Fixed behavior of rendering inline the content of the report - did not work properly for server deployed instances
